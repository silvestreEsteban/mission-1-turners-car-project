# Mission 1
This project is the second assignment/mission assigned by Mission Ready HQ in the Level 5 Tech Accelerator.
The idea is that we have been assigned by Turners (only as a practice, not truly hired by them) to create an AI application where a user can upload an image of car and find out information about that vehicle. 
I have mimicked the layout of the actual Turners Cars website, but have written my own code, functionalities, and uploaded my own images.
